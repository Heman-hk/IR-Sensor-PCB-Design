#  IR Sensor Module â€“ LM358 Based

This project implements a simple **Infrared (IR) proximity sensor** using an IR LED, photodiode, and an LM358 operational amplifier configured as a voltage comparator. Designed for object detection tasks, the circuit generates a digital output when IR light is reflected from a nearby surface.

##  Circuit Description

- **IR LED** emits infrared light continuously.
- **Photodiode** receives reflected IR light and generates a corresponding voltage signal.
- **LM358 Op-Amp** compares the photodiode signal with an adjustable reference voltage (set by RV1).
- **Output Pin (0/P)** goes HIGH when an object is detected (voltage crosses the threshold).

##  Applications

- Obstacle detection for robotics
- Line-following robot modules
- Hand gesture triggers
- Proximity detection for automation

##  Notes

- Adjust RV1 for optimal sensitivity under ambient lighting
- Ensure IR LED and photodiode are mounted parallel to detect reflected light
- Output can be interfaced directly with microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32, Arduino)
